    # Seq2Rel

    A demo for our [Seq2Rel](https://github.com/JohnGiorgi/seq2rel) method.

    Seq2Rel is a generative, sequence-to-sequence based method for end-to-end document-level
    entity and relation extraction.

    1. Select a pretrained model below (it may take a few seconds to load).
    2. Enter some text on the right, and the extracted entity mentions and relations will be visualized below.

    Coreferent mentions will be seperated by a semicolon (`{util.COREF_SEP_SYMBOL}`). Hover over nodes and
    edges to see their predicted classes.
